/**
 * Per-fragment hiding driven by a world-space mask texture.
 *
 * A material patched here asks, for every fragment it shades, "what does the
 * mask say about the ground directly under this pixel?" and throws the fragment
 * away when the answer is *hidden*. Nothing about the containing object enters
 * into it — so a model that straddles a mask boundary is cut by that boundary
 * rather than being shown or hidden as a whole.
 *
 * That distinction is the entire reason this module exists. Object-level hiding
 * (`Object3D.visible`, or a zeroed instance matrix) has to answer for a whole
 * model at one point in space, and there is no good point to pick: a mountain
 * scaled 20× either reveals from a spot deep inside its own silhouette — so the
 * player walks into it before it appears — or reveals from bounds so wide that
 * it is on screen before they have been anywhere near it. Both are the same bug
 * seen from opposite ends, and neither can be tuned away, because the model is
 * not in one place.
 *
 * **Projection is X/Z only.** The mask is a top-down field, so a fragment's
 * height is ignored and a peak is masked by the ground beneath it. That is what
 * makes "half of it is under the mask, so half of it is drawn" true.
 *
 * **Hiding is a dithered `discard`, not a fade.** The three ways to remove a
 * fragment are not equivalent here:
 *
 *  - Blending toward the mask's own colour keeps the material opaque and costs
 *    nothing, but only works where the hidden thing is seen *against* the mask.
 *    A peak standing above the horizon would read as a black silhouette on the
 *    sky, which is exactly the scenery this is meant to hide.
 *  - Real alpha (`transparent: true`) is correct against the sky but moves whole
 *    landscapes into the sorted transparent queue, where instanced scenery sorts
 *    badly and overdraw is paid in full.
 *  - Discarding under a dither threshold keeps the material opaque and
 *    depth-correct, is right against sky and ground alike, and pays only the
 *    lookup. The cost is that the transition band is stippled rather than
 *    smooth — invisible in practice, because the band is a few metres wide and
 *    an antialiasing pass resolves it.
 *
 * The dither is {@link https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MtVDla interleaved
 * gradient noise}: one line, no lookup table, and *static in screen space*, so a
 * held camera shows a still pattern instead of boiling noise.
 *
 * Generic on purpose (CLAUDE.md: engine stays project-agnostic). This module
 * knows about a texture, a world span and a threshold range; it does not know
 * what the mask means. Fog of war is one caller.
