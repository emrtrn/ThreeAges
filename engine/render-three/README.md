# Engine Render Three

This folder owns Three.js adapter code as it is extracted from the current
`src/scene` implementation.

Current files:

- `gltfLoader.ts`: shared GLTFLoader setup for meshoptimizer and KTX2/Basis
  texture transcoding.
- `gltfModelLoader.ts`: per-asset GLTF promise caching on top of the shared
  loader setup.
- `transforms.ts`: Three.js transform helpers for layout placement matrices and
  Euler-degree application.
- `materials.ts`: renderable mesh guard, material stats, and unlit-to-lit
  material conversion helpers.
- `lights.ts`: Three.js light object creation/sync, shadow configuration, and
  editor light icon/wire gizmo construction/disposal helpers.
- `renderer.ts`: WebGLRenderer creation, baseline shadow-map configuration, and
  render statistics helpers.
- `camera.ts`: perspective scene camera creation and responsive viewport/FOV
  application helpers.
- `models.ts`: GLTF scene binding for instanced static meshes and character
  scene objects.
- `picking.ts`: parent-object traversal helpers used by raycast picking.

Rules:

- Three.js runtime objects may live here.
- Serializable scene, asset, and project data must not depend on this folder.
- Editor overlays and gizmos may use this adapter later, but editor state should
  remain editor-owned.
