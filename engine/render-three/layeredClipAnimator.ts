/**
 * Two-channel clip animator: the legs keep their locomotion while a one-shot
 * owns the torso.
 *
 * The same body-mask idea as {@link LayeredCharacterAnimator} — Unreal's
 * "Layered Blend Per Bone" + Slot, as data — but with the opposite ownership
 * model. There, the animator holds the montage's own timer and an aim pose,
 * because a TPS character's shell asks it to *play a montage* and forgets about
 * it. Here the caller already runs a pure state machine that knows exactly which
 * one-shot is playing and how much of it is left, so this class holds no timing
 * at all: it is told what each channel should be showing, and when the torso is
 * handed back.
 *
 * That is also why it ticks its own mixers ({@link update}, matching
 * {@link CrossfadeAnimator.update}) rather than exposing them to an
 * `AnimationSubsystem`: the RTS frame loop owns the tick, and throttles it by
 * distance.
 *
 * Three-touching, so it lives in `engine/render-three`. It holds no game rules —
 * "a walking unit flinches from the waist up" is a decision the caller makes.
