/**
 * Mounting a sidecar-authored socket on a bone, in world units.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: character GLBs in this project are exported from a
 * centimetre pipeline and carry the conversion on their scene root — `Root`,
 * `Archer_Root` and `Guard_Root` all sit at scale 0.01, and every bone beneath
 * them inherits it. A socket group parented straight onto a bone therefore lands
 * in centimetre space, where an authored `position: [0, 0.03, 0.24]` means
 * 0.3mm/2.4mm rather than the 3cm/24cm it reads as, and a prop authored at 4x
 * draws at 4% of its size — a few millimetres, which on screen is nothing at all.
 *
 * The fix is one node, not a convention: a compensator group that cancels the
 * bone's inherited scale, with the authored socket hanging off it. Everything
 * above stays exactly as exported, everything below is in world metres, and the
 * authored numbers finally mean what an artist typing them would expect.
 *
 * Both the runtime binder and the Skeletal Mesh Editor's overlay go through
 * here, because a socket that previews at one size and ships at another is worse
 * than one that is wrong in both places: authoring by eye would encode the error.
