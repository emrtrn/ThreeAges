/**
 * Audio Bus Lite — the pure, headless data model for Forge's mix buses.
 *
 * A bus is just a named gain stage. The runtime topology (built lazily in
 * `audioSubsystem.ts` once a Web Audio context exists) is:
 *
 *   destination ← master ← { music, sfx, ui, ambience, voice, notifications }
 *
 * Every play routes its gain into one bus; non-master buses feed `master`, so a
 * play's effective level is `playGain × busVolume × masterVolume`. A *mix
 * snapshot* is a partial set of target bus volumes (e.g. a pause/menu duck that
 * lowers music + ambience while leaving `ui` alone).
 *
 * This module owns no Web Audio objects so it can be unit-tested on node and
 * imported by pure consumers (e.g. `soundCueTypes.ts`) without pulling in the
 * audio runtime.
 */

/**
 * The mix buses, in routing order under `master`.
 *
 * A bus exists when something has to be turned down *independently of everything
 * else* — that is the only thing a gain stage buys, and an unused one is not
 * free: every id here widens the `*.soundcue.json` schema, the save validator's
 * allowlist, and the cue editor's bus picker.
 *
 * `voice` and `notifications` are separate from `sfx` because the duck rules
 * name them: a critical notice pulls music down, a spoken line pulls nearby
 * combat down, and the accessibility pass promises a slider for each. Combat and
 * world SFX are *not* separate — nothing ducks one against the other, so they
 * share `sfx` until something does.
