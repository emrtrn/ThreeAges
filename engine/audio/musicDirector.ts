/**
 * The music bed: a playlist of tracks that fade into one another.
 *
 * Separate from `AudioEventDirector` on purpose, and the split is the same one
 * that separates a bed from an event. The event director's whole job is deciding
 * *whether* a trigger becomes a play — cooldowns, per-event caps, a distance
 * cull, a shared voice budget. A music bed needs none of those, and needs one
 * thing the director cannot give it: ownership of a long-lived handle, so a
 * track can be faded rather than only started and stopped. `trigger()` keeps its
 * handle private, which is right for the thousand one-shots a match fires and
 * wrong for the two that play for twenty minutes.
 *
 * What it still shares with the table is the *authoring*: the playlist is an
 * event's `clips` array and the level is its `volume`, read by the host and
 * handed in here. A fork retunes its music in `events.json` like everything
 * else; this module owns only the timing.
 *
 * Pure — no Web Audio, no Three.js, no clock of its own. The host advances it
 * with the same monotonic real-seconds reading the audio cooldowns use. Real,
 * not simulation: a crossfade at 8x speed must still take as many wall-clock
 * seconds as it does at 1x, because it is addressed to the player's ear.
