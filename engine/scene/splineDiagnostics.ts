/**
 * Presentation-only spline performance warnings (Faz 12 hardening of

 *
 * Pure and dependency-free: it never touches Three.js, the layout, or generator
 * state, so both the editor Details panel and headless engine checks feed it the
 * counts they already have. Thresholds are soft warnings, not hard limits — the
 * generator code keeps its own `SPLINE_GENERATOR_MAX_INSTANCES` cap. Real limits
 * are meant to be tuned against device benchmarks; these are the safe defaults
 * from the plan's §19.4 table.
