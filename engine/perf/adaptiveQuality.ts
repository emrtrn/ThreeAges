/**
 * Pure adaptive quality control (Adaptive Performance & Graphics Quality, Faz 6).
 *
 * Side-effect free: no DOM, no three.js, no clock of its own. The `src/scene`
 * subsystem wrapper feeds this the windowed {@link FrameMetrics}, the elapsed
 * seconds and a `classify` closure each tick; this module decides whether to
 * step quality down (fast, under load), back up (slow, only once stable) or hold,
 * and layers that as a **transient reduction stack** over the player's base
 * profile. Because it only takes already-measured numbers it is deterministic and
 * unit-tested without a browser.
 *
 * Three ideas from the plan (§9, §10, §12):
 *
 * 1. **Decide, then apply.** {@link decideAdaptiveStep} is the plan §12 pure
 *    decision — none / reduce / increase — driven by frame time vs. the target
 *    with hysteresis (drop fast, raise cautiously) and a cooldown. It never picks
 *    *which* setting to change; that is the applier's job.
 * 2. **One small rung at a time.** The applier walks an ordered reduction ladder
 *    (§10.1 GPU order, §10.2 CPU order) least-visible-first, choosing the first
 *    rung that matches the detected bottleneck family. Effective settings are
 *    always re-folded from the base through the applied stack, so raising quality
 *    is just popping the last rung (LIFO) — no drift, fully reversible.
 * 3. **Never above the player's ceiling.** The base is the player's chosen (or
 *    calibrated) profile. Adaptive only reduces *below* it and restores back *up
 *    to* it — it can never exceed a manual selection (plan §17.3). The transient
 *    reductions are never persisted (plan §17.6); only the base is.
