/**
 * Pure bottleneck classification (Adaptive Performance & Graphics Quality, Faz 5).
 *
 * Side-effect free: no DOM, no three.js, no clock. It reasons over
 * already-collected signals — {@link FrameMetrics}, the CPU
 * {@link SubsystemProfileSnapshot}, the perf-budget rows and (rarely) a
 * render-scale probe — and returns a probability-weighted verdict with evidence.
 * Because it only takes numbers, it is deterministic and unit-tested without a
 * browser.
 *
 * The browser cannot cleanly separate GPU from CPU time on every device (plan
 * §8), so this is **probabilistic**, not a measurement. It leans first on the
 * free *passive* signals Forge already has (plan §8.1):
 *
 * - Smooth average but a hitchy P95 → a spike, not steady load. Don't drop
 *   quality; blame a load / GC / shader compile (transient / asset / memory).
 * - Sustained over-budget frame + subsystems explaining most of it → **CPU**
 *   bound, and the profiler already names the worst subsystem to target (§10.2).
 * - Sustained over-budget frame + subsystems explaining little → the cost is
 *   off-CPU → **GPU** / compositor (or draw-call prep, which a budget overage
 *   disambiguates).
 *
 * Only when the passive signals are inconclusive does a caller run the rare,
 * short render-scale probe (§8.2) and feed its result back in as extra evidence.
