/**
 * Minimal 2D grid navigation for AI path requests.
 *
 * Pure engine module: no DOM, Three.js or editor imports. The first
 * implementation plans over X/Z using static blocker AABBs inflated by the
 * agent radius. It is intentionally small so higher-level AI can start using
 * path-following before a full navmesh/Recast adapter exists.
 *
 * Navigation contract (Unreal/Recast `Agent Radius` analogue): a path point is
 * the agent capsule *center* at foot height, never a surface point. Obstacles
 * are eroded by an effective clearance so the capsule body stays clear:
 *
 *   effectiveRadius = agent.radius + agent.clearancePadding + safetyMargin
 *
 * `clearancePadding` is optional per-agent slack beyond the capsule radius (kept
 * small so narrow corridors stay traversable). `safetyMargin` absorbs the grid
 * discretization error and defaults to `cellSize * 0.5` — half a cell, the worst
 * case rounding of a continuous position onto a cell center. Authored navigation
 * bounds are eroded inward by the same effective radius.
