/**
 * Stamp `public/assets/audio/` into the asset manifest — audio plan §81.4.
 *
 * Dropping a produced clip into the project is meant to be three steps, of which
 * only the first is creative: put the file in its folder (§7), register it as a
 * manifest `sound` asset, point an event at it (`events.json`). The middle step
 * is 30 lines of boilerplate per clip with four fields that actually vary, and
 * one of them — `bytes` — is a number a human has no way to know. That is a
 * transcription job, so it belongs to a script.
 *
 * **There is deliberately no second table to maintain.** The obvious design is a
 * list of clips somewhere that this reads; the reason not to is that §6 and §7
 * already *are* that list. The file name carries the id (`sfx_artillery_fire_01`
 * → `sfx-artillery-fire-01`), the folder carries the category, and the manifest
 * carries the result. A hand-written table in between would be a third place to
 * keep in sync with the other two, and the failure it invites is the quiet kind:
 * a table row for a file that was renamed, or a file no row ever mentions.
 *
 * What is *not* derived is anything a person authored. An existing entry keeps
 * its `name` and `license` — "UI Click" and "Notification Info" are editorial
 * and a title-caser would flatten them to "Ui Click" and "Notify Info". Only the
 * mechanical fields are rewritten, so running this twice changes nothing.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run audio:manifest           # write
 *   npm run audio:manifest -- --check  # report only; non-zero if out of date
