/**
 * Does this browser actually play what we ship? — audio plan §52's "browser
 * codec test".
 *
 * The project ships **one** format: 264 Ogg Vorbis files, no fallback, chosen in
 * §8 and never tested outside Chromium. That is a single point of failure with
 * an unusually bad shape — a browser that cannot decode Vorbis does not play a
 * degraded mix, it plays *nothing*, and until today it did so without a word in
 * the console. So the question this answers is not "how does it sound" but "is
 * there any sound at all", and it is the one audio question a listening test on
 * one machine can never reach.
 *
 * **Both runtime paths are probed, because they are not the same decoder.**
 * Short sounds go through `decodeAudioData` (Web Audio) and beds go through a
 * media element (`AudioPlayOptions.stream`, §61.1). A browser can support a
 * format in one and not the other, and a probe that only asked `canPlayType`
 * would answer for neither: it reports an *intention* ("maybe"/"probably"), not
 * a decode. So this decodes a real shipped clip and loads a real shipped bed.
 *
 * Engines are probed only if Playwright has them installed; a missing one is
 * reported as missing rather than skipped silently, with the command to get it.
 * Chromium alone is not a codec test — it is the browser the project was
 * developed in, and the one result already known.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run audio:codecs
 *   npx playwright install webkit firefox   # what makes the answer complete
