 * the shared boot/travel loading overlay handoff and the pending-restore latch
 * (owned by the save coordinator) stay in {@link RuntimeSceneApp} and are reached
 * through these callbacks. The loading overlay is deliberately NOT moved here: it
 * is shared with the boot lifecycle (`loadActiveProjectScene` + per-phase
 * `setLoadingStatus`), so owning it in a travel-scoped module would force boot to
 * depend on travel. Keeping it in the shell preserves the one-way
