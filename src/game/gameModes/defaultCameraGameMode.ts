/**
 * `forge.defaultCamera` — the built-in default Game Mode.
 *
 * Spawns a runtime-only camera pawn (the live camera itself; no scene object,
 * nothing written to the layout) and drives it with WASD. It never possesses a
 * character, even when the scene contains an `input-move` one — that auto-possess
 * rule belongs only to the explicitly selected TPS mode. Physics, audio and
 * behavior subsystems keep running; this session only owns the camera.
 *
 * Controls match the editor viewport's feel: WASD pans along the camera's facing
 * and a held right-mouse drag turns the view (yaw/pitch). The camera keeps
 * whatever pose it boots with — the scene's default framing, or the editor
 * camera pose handed off through the Play button — instead of being reframed.
