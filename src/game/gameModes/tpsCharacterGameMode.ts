 * Possesses one player character and drives a behind-and-above follow camera plus
 * the crossfade locomotion animator (the gameplay that previously lived hardcoded
 * in `RuntimeSceneApp`). The player is chosen explicitly: a character tagged with
 * metadata `player: true` wins, otherwise the first character carrying the
 * `input-move` behavior. Because this only runs when the user selects TPS in
 * World Settings, an `input-move` character is never auto-played by the default
 * camera mode — `input-move` stays a general behavior, not a "player" marker.
