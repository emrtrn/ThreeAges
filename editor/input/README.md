# Editor Input

Editor DOM input helpers live here.

Current files:

- `bindings.ts`: editor-only DOM listener wiring for pointer, keyboard,
  drag/drop, wheel, and cleanup.
- `keyboard.ts`: keyboard-code filters and editable-target guards for editor controls.

Rules:

- This folder may use browser DOM APIs.
- Runtime game code must not import this folder.
- Pure editor state helpers belong in `editor/core`, not here.
