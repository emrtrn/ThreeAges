# Editor Gizmos

Editor transform gizmo helpers live here as they are extracted from `SceneApp`.

Current files:

- `axes.ts`: transform gizmo axis contracts and axis-index helpers.

Rules:

- Gizmo modules may depend on editor-core and engine data contracts.
- Runtime game code must not import this folder.
- Three.js helper rendering can move here when the gizmo renderer is extracted.
